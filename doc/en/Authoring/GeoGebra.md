# GeoGebra in STACK

Author Tim Lutz - University of Edinburgh and University of Education Heidelberg, 2022-23.

STACK supports inclusion of dynamic graphs using GeoGebra: [https://geogebra.org](https://geogebra.org).  This page documents how to use GeoGebra applets to display visuals, and as a STACK input.


## Before we start: Check Editor preferences

Note, we strongly recommend you do not use an HTML-aware editor when using GeoGebra questions.  Instead turn off the editor within Moodle and edit the raw HTML.

    Site administration > Plugins > Text editors > Manage editors

Individual users can also set their editor preferences:

    User Dashboard > Preferences > Editor preferences > Manage editors

## Find the material_id

To include a GeoGebra applet into a STACK question, first create or search for an existing GeoGebra applet at geogebra.org. The easiest way to use GeoGebra in STACK is to use an applet at geogebra.org. The applet must be publicly avaiable through a url. To set things up we need the material-id of an applet, we want to show.

For the material [https://www.geogebra.org/m/seehz3km](https://www.geogebra.org/m/seehz3km) the material_id is: `seehz3km`

## Add the material_id to a new STACK task

Then include the following question text, which includes a simple `[[geogebra]]` [block](Question_blocks.md).

    <p>You can show an applet:</p>
    [[geogebra]]
    params["material_id"]="seehz3km";
    [[/geogebra]]

## Using the sub-tags "set", "watch" and "remember"

### naming conventions

The sub-tag `set` parameter value is a string of (unique), comma-separated, GeoGebra-objects with latin names.
For example, the sub-tag value could look like:  `set = "A,B,C,D,a2,E__fixed"` and would be placed in the block as

    [[geogebra set = "A,B,C,D,a2,E__fixed"]]
    [[/geogebra]]

To be able to make things easy for question authors, the following name conventions _must_ be followed:

1. Names of variables must be equal in STACK and GeoGebra.
2. Values are `int` or `float` STACK variables.
3. Points are represented as array in STACK like: e.g. `[2,3]`, which means a point with \(x=2, y=3\).  The Maxima object would be for point \(D\) e.g. `D:[2,3]`.
4. Value-names must start with lower case letters.
5. Angles are used like values, and so must be named lowercase letters in Latin-Alphabet, (not Greek unicode letters!) and values are radians
6. Point-names must start with upper case letters

## Using the "set" sub-tag

With the "set" sub-tag you can set a GeoGebra object point or value to a STACK-calculated value.

Points will be set free to manipulate, unless you add `__fixed` or other double-underscore-tags to the Point-name. A full list of available options see "set: double-underscore-tags in the "advanced use-cases"-section.  Angles cannot be set directly, set points instead!

### A minimal example

Set the question variables:

    A:[2,3];
    B:[1,2];

Set the question text:

    [[geogebra set="A,B"]]
    params["material_id"]="seehz3km";
    [[/geogebra]]
    Write the coordinates of \(A\): [[input:ans1]][[validation:ans1]]

Then you will need to fill in the teacher's answer and a PRT to make a working question.  (Also, be sure to set HTML format for the question text if useing the plain text edit.)

## Using the "watch" sub-tag 

With the "watch" sub-tag someone can listen to values and points in GeoGebra. These values can then be used to calculate feedback in STACK.  The values will be assigned to a STACK input.  Note, inputs can be "hidden" from the student.

### Minimal example watching point A and value or angle b

Set the question variables to be empty in this example.

Set the question text:

    [[geogebra watch="A,b"]]
    params["material_id"]="seehz3km";
    [[/geogebra]]
    [[input:A]][[validation:A]]
    [[input:b]][[validation:b]]

Note:
1. `A` _must_ be an algebraic-input and you _must_ allow floats!
2. You can access `A` in STACK for feedback as a list of values for points `A[0]->x-value`, `A[1]->y-value`
3. You can access `b` in STACK as value. If `b` represents an angle then `b` is in radians.
4. Later we will [hide the inputs](Inputs.md#extra_option_hideanswer) from students, but for testing it is helpful to see the input boxes.  This is done with the STACK "extra option" `hideanswer` in the input.

## Using the "remember" sub-tag

If you do not want to calculate feedback with some of the GeoGebra objects in an applet, but you do want to be able to save and restore the state of an applet, you can use the "remember" tag.

You still need an input in the question to store these values. The only way STACK can store "state" is through inputs.
This input _must_ be of type "string" (because we store these values as a JSON-string internally).

### Minimal example remember A,B,C

Set the question variables to be empty in this example.

Set the question text:

    [[geogebra remember="A,B,C"]]
    params["material_id"]="seehz3km";
    [[/geogebra]]
    [[input:remember]][[validation:remember]]

1. The input _must_ be of type string, and can not be used to calculate values in STACK feedback for now. 
2. The name "remember" is for easy restoring purposes.  Of course, any name could be used.
3. Remember to [hide the input](Inputs.md#extra_option_hideanswer) from students with the STACK "extra option" `hideanswer` in the input.

## Advanced use-cases

### set: double-underscore-tags

The set sub-tag allows more control over setting objects:

#### "preserve" keyword

If you want to preserve GeoGebra definitions of points or values when setting them add the __preserve keyword to that object.

##### Common example: "Points on objects"

For example, assume "A" is a GeoGebra-Point on an object, like A is a point on the circle B.
When you set A like:
`set ="A"`, the definition of A will be overwritten by default.
When you set A like:
`set="A__preserve"`
then `"A__preserve"` will preserve that A is a Point on B and tries to set A near to your STACK variable A but on the circle.

##### Common example: "Sliders"

"a" should be a GeoGebra-value controlled by a slider ranging from -5 to 5.
When you set a like:
`set = "a"`, the definition of a will be overwritten, e.g. if the STACK variable a is 10, after initialization a is 10 in GeoGebra.
When you set a like:
`set = "a__preserve"`
then `"a__preserve"` will preserve that a is in range -5 to 5. If you set a in STACK to 10, a in GeoGebra will be set to the nearest value, in this example a will be 5 in GeoGebra.

#### hide and show keyword

If you want to set and hide a value in GeoGebra add the __hide or __show keyword.

1. `set="a__hide"` -> set and hide
2. `set="a__show"` -> set and show

#### Multiple keywords

A__hide__fixed->set A as a fixed point and hide it.
A__fixed__hide-> keyword order is not relevant, set A as a fixed point and hide it.

-special keyword `novalue`
The GeoGebraobject value should not be set, this keyword is helpful, if you just want to hide or show something, see "multiple keywords"

set="A__hide__novalue"->hide A, but do not set A

set="A_hide_novalue" watch="A" -> watch A, but hide it and do not set it.

### Using commands inside `[[geogebra]][[/geogebra]]`

You can use the following commands inside the geogebra tag if the sub tags cant fit your task idea:

* `stack_geogebra_bind_point(args)`
* `stack_geogebra_bind_value(args)`
* `stack geogebra_bind_value_to_remember_JSON(args)`
* `stack geogebra_bind_point_to_remember_JSON(args)`

#### minimal example

    [[geogebra input-ref-stateStore="stateRef" set="b" watch="B"]]
    params["material_id"]="AEAVEqPy";
    params["appletOnLoad"]=function(){stack_geogebra.bind_point_to_remember_JSON(stateRef,appletObject, 'A');
    stack_geogebra.bind_value_to_remember_JSON(stateRef,appletObject, 'c')};
    [[/geogebra]]
    [[input:stateStore]]
    [[validation:stateStore]]
    [[input:B]][[validation:B]]
